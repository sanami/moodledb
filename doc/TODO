I'd like to produce either a wiki or a database activity for my Moodle from an excel database.

I've still got to define the content a little better but the idea is that the tags will bring up the examples and mp3.
if you go to campuslinguaonline and "search the site" you can get an idea of what i'm doing here.

I think the only important thing is to create something which is compatible with Moodle 1.9 and 2.2.

I've been using Georgia 10.

I'll want to have the same features as elsewhere - that's to say, playback and then a record feature.

What would be great would be to find a nicer recorder that displays spectrograms or some sort of speech recognition tool so that a user "sees" the original and can compare his own voice. Any ideas on that?

I wonder if the Kaltura tools do this.


If you have a minute and want to get familiar with the site and the wikis at present, I've created a login for you.

Type something in the "search the site" box and you should get a wiki.
It's at www.campuslinguaonline.com
